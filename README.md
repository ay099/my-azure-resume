# my-azure-resume  _not completed_
My cloud resume built and maintained using azure services. Built based on the Cloud Resume Challenge 
 
 ## Structure Layout

 - The frontend directory contains the major frontend stuff. The CSS files, The homepage html file, and helper scripts.

 - The backend contains an api directory which will house my api calls to my Cosmos DB account on my Azure Subscription, it also contains a test directory.

- The app.js file houses the website visitors counter code

- The api directory contains a Microsoft function app with C# templates 


## Azure Services Used.

- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Application Insights
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Function App
- Azure CDN. I do think it's important to know that I linked an already created domain name to the CDN as Azure CDN does not allow customers to create a domain name as of this documentation.
